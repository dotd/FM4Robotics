# Industrial Context Ideas

In this MD we describe the ideas that academic papers has in the context of FM4R, and how
such ideas can be translated into FM4IR (Foundation Models for Industrial Robotics)

Note that the ideas might be ranked.

1. ["Towards A Unified Agent with Foundation Models"](mds/Towards%20A%20Unified%20Agent%20with%20Foundation%20Models.md)
   - The paper gives an architecture of CLIP, T5, and so on to take a prompt, decomposing
   them into sub-goals, and then execute each subgoal to achieve the main goal. 
   - Same can be done with industrial use-case.
